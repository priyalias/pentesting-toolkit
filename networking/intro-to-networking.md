## Unique Identifiers of Network
- **Hostname**
    - Each device in the network is associated with a unique device name known as "Hostname".
- **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)**
    - Network address of the system across the network. (ifconfig)
- **MAC Address**
Physical address, unique identifier of each host and is associated with the NIC aka Network Interface Card (ifconfig -a ether)
- **Port**
    - A logical channel through which data can be sent/received by an application.
    - Each application is identified through the port number on which it is running.
    - `netstat -a` lists all the ports being used.
- **Socket**
    - Unique combination of IP address and Port number together
- **DNS Server**
    - DNS Domain Name System
    - `nslookup` gives the IP Address of the domain
- **ARP**
    - Address Resolution Protocol
    - Convert an IP Address to its corresponding physical address
    - Used by the Data Link Layer to identify MAC Address of the receiving machine
- **RARP**
    - Reverse Address Resolution Protocol
    - Converts MAC address to IP
    - Has become obsolete since DHCP came into picture
- **Switches**
    - Acts as a controller to connect various devices to a network in a building or campus
    - Two types of Switches - On-Premises and Cloud-Managed
- **Routers**
    - Connects multiple networks together, also connects computer in a network to the internet
    - Acts as a dispatcher, analyses data being sent out choose the efficient route for the data to travel
    - Protect from security threats
    - Depending on the function, we can choose from a Virtual Private Network (VPN), Internet Protocol (IP) or router with firewall


## IP and MAC Addresses:
- ifconfig
    -inet (ipv4 address)
    - inet6 (ipv6 address)
    - NAT (Network Address Translation)
    - Private IP Addresses not used anywhere on public internet, reserved for LANs, can be seen with ifconfig
    - dnsleaktest 185.130.47.58
    - MAC (Media Access Control) Address the physical address of the device which communicates with switches, denoted as "ether" in ifconfig
    - Anything that uses a network interface will have a MAC address


## TCP and UDP (Transmission Control Protocol and User Datagram Protocol) :
- TCP is connectivity protocol while UDP is connectionless
    - TCP is highly reliable used for websites, ssh, ftp etc.
    - UDP used for streaming, dns etc.
- TCP works with Three-Way Handshake
    - Three-Way Handshake:
        - send out SYN packet > receive SYN ACK packet > send ACK packet
        - the above packets can be used in various ports


## Common Ports and Protocols:
Protocol is a set of rules and algorithms which define the way how two entities can communicate across the network.
- **TCP**
    - **FTP File Transfer Protocol (21):** get or put a file on the server
    - **SSH (22):** similar to telnet, logs onto a remote server, is encrypted
    - **Telnet (23):** similar to ssh, logs onto a remote server, is in clear text
    - **SMTP (25):** related to mails
    - **DNS Domain Name System (53):** resolves an ip address to human readable domain name
    - **HTTP (80) / HTTPS (443):** used for web apps, HTTP is not encrypted and thus not secure HTTPS is encrypted and secure
    - **POP3 (110):** related to mails
    - **SMB (139 + 445):** related to file sharing, is exploited often during pentesting
    - **IMAP (143):** related to mails
- **UDP**
    - **DNS Domain Name System (53):** similar to the TCP DNS
    - **DHCP (67, 68):** assigns a random ip address when the device connects to the internet, also assigns a static ip address to a specific device based on the device's MAC address
    - **TFTP Trivial File Transfer Protocol (69):** similar to FTP but utilises UDP instead of TCP
    - **SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol (161):** will be seen ocassionally on networks but will probably have some important information when we do encounter it


## OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)
1. **Physical:** data cables, cat6
2. **Data:** switching, MAC addresses
3. **Network:** IP Addresses, routing
4. **Transport:** TCP/UDP
5. **Session:** session management
6. **Presentation:** WMV, JPEG, MOV
7. **Application:** HTTP, SMTP
